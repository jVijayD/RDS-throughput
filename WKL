Workload Characteristics: Certain types of workloads, such as OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) systems with frequent small transactions,
can lead to high throughput but relatively low CPU usage
To reduce the workload characteristics and alleviate the strain on your database, you can take several approaches to optimize your application and database architecture. Here are some strategies to consider:

Query Optimization:

Review and optimize your database queries to ensure they are efficient and use appropriate indexes. Identify and fix any long-running or poorly performing queries.
Data Modeling:

Optimize your data model to reduce redundancy and improve query performance. Use denormalization or data partitioning when appropriate to minimize the complexity of complex queries.
Caching:

Implement caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed data in memory. Caching can reduce the need to fetch data from the database for every request, resulting in lower database workload.
Asynchronous Processing:

Offload non-time-sensitive or resource-intensive tasks from your main application thread by using asynchronous processing or background jobs. This can reduce the immediate workload on the database.
Load Balancing and Read Replicas:

Distribute read traffic across multiple read replicas to reduce the load on the primary database instance. Load balancing can help evenly distribute requests and improve overall performance.
Connection Pooling:

Use connection pooling to efficiently manage and reuse database connections. Connection pooling reduces the overhead of creating and closing connections for each client request.
Data Archiving and Purging:

Regularly review your data and archive or purge older or unnecessary data to reduce the volume of data that needs to be processed by the database.
Optimize Indexing:

Ensure that your database has appropriate indexes for the most common queries. Remove unused or redundant indexes to reduce the overhead of maintaining them.
Vertical Scaling:

If your workload requires more computational power, consider vertically scaling your database instance by choosing an instance type with more CPU and memory resources.
Horizontal Scaling:

For workloads with high concurrency, consider horizontal scaling by sharding your data across multiple database instances. Horizontal scaling can distribute the load and improve performance.
Offload Processing to Other Services:

Offload specific tasks to other AWS services when possible. For example, use AWS Lambda for serverless processing or Amazon SQS for message queueing.
Review Application Logic:

Analyze your application logic and design to ensure it is optimized for performance. Avoid redundant or unnecessary operations.
Remember to regularly monitor your database performance to assess the effectiveness of the optimizations and make data-driven decisions. Implement changes gradually and test thoroughly to ensure that they do not adversely affect the functionality or stability of your application.
